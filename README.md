# Obsidian Upcoming

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that opens upcoming (and/or past) [daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) in their own panes/tabs/windows, so you can see and plan ahead. Check out the plugin settings before using the provided commands:

- **Open upcoming notes:** If a daily note is in the currently active pane, this command will open upcoming notes relative to that date. Otherwise, it will start from today.
- **Create upcoming notes:** Creates non-existing upcoming notes without opening them.
- **Close notes:** Closes all daily note opened previously by the plugin.
